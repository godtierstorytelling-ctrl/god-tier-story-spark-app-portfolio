## 🌟 god-Tier Story Spark App
AI-Powered Story Ideation App (Portfolio Version)

This is the public-facing portfolio repository for Story Spark, a web application designed to help writers generate ideas, loglines, heroes, worlds, and story structures using Next.js, React, and the OpenAI API.

- 🔗 **Live App:** https://story-spark-wine.vercel.app/
- 🔗 **Demo Video:** Coming Soon!


## 🚀 Overview

Story Spark is an AI-assisted writing tool that helps storytellers:

- Generate idea sparks
- Create loglines
- Build heroes and villains
- Develop worlds & settings
- Draft scenes
- Build writing habits
- And more!

This repository provides an overview of the project, the architecture, and the technologies used — but does NOT include proprietary code, API keys, or private logic.
A private GitHub repository with the full source code can be shared upon request.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

This is a portfolio-only repository.
It deliberately does not include:

- ❌ API keys
- ❌ Environment variables
- ❌ Source code
- ❌ GPT logic or prompt chains
- ❌ Proprietary Story Spark logic
- ❌ Internal system architecture

A private code repository exists and can be shared upon request with trusted recruiters or employers under NDA.

## 🧩 How It Works (High-Level)

To respect security and proprietary constraints, here is a simplified architecture:
- User interacts with Story Spark UI (Next.js + React)
- App sends requests to serverless API endpoints (Next.js API routes)
- Backend API calls OpenAI’s GPT models
- Responses return structured story data back to the UI
- Vercel handles serverless execution + global CDN caching

_(See /docs/architecture.md for a visual diagram.)_

## 🛠️ Development Process

**This project demonstrates proficiency in:**
- Full-stack JavaScript development
- Integrating with third-party AI APIs
- Designing serverless backend architectures
- Managing environment variables
- Deploying with Vercel’s cloud platform
- Modern UI development and responsive design
- Iterative development, testing, and deployment

## 💼 Want to See the Real Code?

Because Story Spark is part of a commercial product suite (god-Tier Storytelling University), the full source code lives in a private repository.
