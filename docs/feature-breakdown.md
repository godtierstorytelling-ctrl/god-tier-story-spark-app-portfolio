## 🌟 Story Spark — Feature Breakdown (Portfolio Version)

Story Spark is an AI-powered writing companion designed to help storytellers generate, shape, and expand story ideas. This document summarizes the core features of the application from a functional (not code-level) perspective. All proprietary logic and implementation details remain private.

## 🔥 1. Story Spark Engine Modules

Story Spark is organized into a series of modular writing tools. Each module focuses on one aspect of storytelling and can be used independently or as part of the full story-building workflow.

<h3> ✨ 1.1 Idea Spark Module </h3>

Generates raw story ideas and concept fragments to kickstart creativity. Capabilities include:

- Prompt-based idea generation
- “What-if” scenarios
- Trope remixing
- Mood & vibe generation
- Randomized spark suggestions

This module is the starting point for most users.

<h3> 🦸 1.2 Hero Builder Module </h3>

Guides users through creating a compelling protagonist. Supports:

- Hero motivations
- Wants vs Needs
- Fears, flaws, and contradictions
- Unique traits and quirks
- Hero summaries

Outputs are structured so that later modules (plot, conflict, scenes) can reference them.

<h3> 🦂 1.3 Opposition Builder Module </h3>

Creates villains, rivals, or antagonistic forces with depth and nuance. Features include:

- Opposition motivations
- Methods and obstacles
- Why they’re compelling
- Hero vs Opposition contrast
- Stakes and conflict alignment

Built to avoid “flat” or one-dimensional villains.

<h3> 🌍 1.4 World Seed Module </h3>

A fast, powerful worldbuilding tool designed for both simple and complex settings. Helps users define:

- World type (real, near-future, fantasy, post-apocalyptic)
- Signature features (power systems, culture, geography)
- Environmental conflicts
- Early lore or mythos
- 2–3 sentence world seed summary

Designed to seed future expansion without requiring full worldbuilding upfront.

<h3> 🔦 1.5 Signature Feature Module </h3>

Deepens the world by focusing on a single, world-defining element. Users can develop:

- Power systems
- Cultural hierarchies
- Societal conflicts
- Environmental challenges
- Key atmospheric elements

This becomes a “world anchor” they refer back to while plotting.

## 🧵 2. Plot Development Modules

Story Spark includes tools to help users transform sparks into structured story arcs.

<h3> 🎭 2.1 Logline Module </h3>

Generates concise one-sentence story foundations, combining:

- Hero

Helps users articulate the “core promise” of their story.

<h3> 🧠 2.2 Starter Plot Structure Module </h3>

Introduces essential story frameworks:

- 3-Act
- 4-Act
- Hybrid structures

Users can develop 3–4 beats per act to outline the story skeleton.

<h3> 🗺️ 2.3 Expanded Plot Structure Module </h3>

Builds on the starter outline using:

- 5-Act structure
- 8-Adventure structure

Encourages deeper turning points, thresholds, arenas, and stakes escalation.

<h3> 🥁 2.4 Beat Sheet Module </h3>

Creates a story beat list including:

- Inciting incident
- Midpoint
- Reversal points
- Climax
- Resolution
- Optional “if/then” branching beats

Provides a roadmap for drafting scenes.

## ✍️ 3. Scene Writing Modules

After plotting, users can test scenes with guided drafting tools.

<h3> 🖊️ 3.1 Scene Draft Module </h3>

Helps users draft short scenes (100–500 words) using:
- Scenario input
